# Calorie Tracker

## Overview:
This web application enables users to monitor their caloric intake by logging their daily meals. The main feature of the app is a database that users can update with their favorite food products. For each product, the database stores essential nutritional values per 100 grams, including calories, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Users can add their products and search for them using a responsive search function or by scanning product barcodes.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
This web app offers a modern and efficient interface, primarily based on a single-page application approach that relies heavily on JavaScript for dynamic data fetching and updating. Additionally, it features a robust API on the backend that provides significant flexibility. The API is built using Django and the Django Rest Framework (DRF), allowing users to access a user-friendly interface for API testing. No other projects in CS50W utilize Django Rest Framework, which allowed me to explore this popular tool independently through reading the documentation and experimenting with its features. 

Moreover, I have incorporated another Python module, django-filter, which integrates with DRF to facilitate the sending of search queries to my API. My unique approach to this web application allows for a better separation of the frontend and backend components. Currently, I am using a convenient, minimalistic, and responsive interface built with Bootstrap; however, it is feasible to modify the app to use another frontend framework, such as React or Angular, which is a goal for the future development of this project.

One of the standout features of my application is the ability to scan barcodes or QR codes to identify food products, achieved through the integration of an exciting project called html5-qrcode.

In my app, the models for the Django ORM are extensive and complex. I am using a large set of model definitions, and the complexity is further increased by the introduction of inheritanceâ€”the Product model class inherits from the Food model class. Additionally, I have defined a custom field called PositiveDecimalField, which extends the models.DecimalField. Moreover, I utilize a @property decorator to create methods that function like attributes, allowing for dynamic value calculations.

The database models are delivered to the frontend of the app through Django Rest Framework serializers and viewsets. While a lot of functionality is available out of the box, I made several modifications to ensure that only the data belonging to the user is presented. I extended the relevant methods to verify whether the request is coming from the user designated as the owner of the data in the database. To prevent malicious users from deleting all data, I implemented a system that allows the admin to "lock" certain products in the database. This feature prevents deletion or modification of these products unless they are unlocked by the admin. I achieved this by further extending Django Rest Framework methods to check if a given food product is marked as locked in the database.

To dynamically render the appropriate pages in my nearly single-page application, I utilize a feature of HTML called templates. I have created a large set of templates that I load using JavaScript and modify or extend as needed to incorporate essential elements into my app's interface.

## How to Run the Application
Make sure you have Python 3, PIP, and the Python venv installed on your system. For Debian-based systems, you can ensure you have everything you need by entering the following command:
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip 
``` 
Once you have cloned or downloaded the source code, navigate to the root folder of the calorie-tracker and run the following commands: 
```
bash python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver 
``` 
If you are using a different operating system, you will need to figure out how to install the modules specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Make sure to run the command `python3 manage.py migrate` before executing `python3 manage.py runserver`.
